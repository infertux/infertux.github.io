Here it is. Yet yet another shiny tech blog. It's been a while that I wanted to
start one and because I like the <abbr title="Do-It-Yourself">DIY</abbr>
principle, I had forked [toto](https://github.com/cloudhead/toto) and started
some work adding new features.

But time goes fast and I realize that making my own blog engine is certainly
fun but if I want to be able to blog some day, I should spend time on other
stuff.

It happens that [Octopress](https://github.com/imathis/octopress) seems to be a
sweet blog engine which fits me quite well so I'll give it a try.

Now, a proper article should come soon...
