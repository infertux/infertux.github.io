I decided it was about time to upgrade this site to Octopress 3.
Then I realised that Octopress 3 is basically Jekyll and some deployment scripts, which I don't need, therefore I'm converting this blog to Jekyll.
Thank you Octopress, you've been very helpful for all these years.

But it's time to go back to the roots with a slimmed down design and no more JavaScript bloat, yay!
While I'm at it, I'm adding DNSSEC, HTTPS (thanks Let's Encrypt) and hopefully IPv6 as well...
