<h3>Hi! I'm Ced.</h3>

<p>I love programming, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">free/libre software</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware">open hardware</a>, privacy, cryptocurrencies, music, skiing &amp; ampersands.</p>

<p>I'm a software engineer by trade and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps#DevOps_as_a_job_title">devops</a> by passion &ndash; part-time entrepreneur, part-time freelancer and part-time living the life.</p>

<h3>Enough fluffies, talk dirty to me!</h3>

<p>I really love programming,
from <span title="Did you know that `xor rax, rax` is faster than `mov rax, 0`?">crafting low-level x86 assembly</span>
to <span title="Metaprogramming is my passion.">writing fancy Ruby on Rails apps</span>
and <span title="DevOps FTW!">deploying them with Chef</span>.</p>

<p>I also like to play with hardware,
from spreading thermal grease
to configuring GPIOs of <span title="Well... not so giant.">giant</span> robots.</p>
