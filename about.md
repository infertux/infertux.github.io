  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">free/libre software</a>,
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware">open hardware</a>,
  <a href="https://infertux.com/labs/zeyple/">privacy</a>,
  <a href="https://infertux.com/labs/lifechart/">philosophy</a>,
  <a href="https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/bitcoin">cryptocurrencies</a>,
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_nomad">travelling</a>
  &amp; ampersands.
</p>

<p>I'm a software engineer by trade and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps#DevOps_as_a_job_title">devops</a> by passion &ndash; part-time entrepreneur, part-time freelancer and part-time living the life.</p>

### Contact

You can contact me <a href="mailto:cedric AT felizard.eu" data-proofer-ignore>there</a>.
Please use <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infertux/dotfiles/master/0xEEC73D5809A98A9B.asc" target="_blank">PGP</a> if you can.

You can also <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cedricfelizard">hire me</a> for contract work or your crazy startup, I'm always interested to take on exciting projects.

### Donations

If you like <a href="/">what I build</a>, you can donate to me on
<a href="https://liberapay.com/infertux">librepay.com</a> or
<a href="https://www.patreon.com/infertux">patreon.com</a>.

This allows me to shift my time from writing proprietary software to writing Free Software.
Hopefully, I'll be able to make a living solely from the latter one day... one glorious day.
So I'm very grateful for any contributions toward that goal.

### Enough fluffies, talk dirty to me!

<p>I really love programming,
from <span title="Did you know that `xor rax, rax` is faster than `mov rax, 0`?">crafting low-level x86 assembly</span>
to <span title="Metaprogramming is my passion.">writing fancy Ruby on Rails apps</span>
and <span title="DevOps FTW!">deploying them with Chef</span>.</p>

<p>I also like to play with hardware,
from spreading thermal grease
to configuring GPIOs of <span title="Well... not so giant.">giant</span> robots.</p>
