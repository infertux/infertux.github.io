<h3>Hi! I'm CÃ©dric.</h3>

<p>I love the Web, <abbr title="Free/Libre Open-Source Software">FLOSS</abbr>,
programming, music, skiing,
Internet memes &amp; ampersands.</p>

<p>I'm a Systems and Software Engineer, part-time entrepreneur, part-time freelancer, part-time living the life.</p>

<h3>Enough fluffies, talk dirty to me!</h3>

<p>I enjoy programming,
from <span title="Did you know that `xor rax, rax` is faster than `mov rax, 0`?">crafting low-level x86 assembly</span>
to <span title="Metaprogramming is my passion.">writing fancy Ruby on Rails apps</span>
and <span title="DevOps FTW!">deploying them with Chef</span>.</p>

<p>I also like to play with hardware,
from spreading thermal grease
to configuring GPIOs of <span title="Well... not so giant.">giant</span> robots.</p>
